🧠 Agentic AI-Based Healthcare Decision Support System
📌 Overview

This project presents a Multi-Agent Healthcare Decision Support System designed for ICU mortality risk prediction and hospital operations optimization.

The system integrates Machine Learning (XGBoost) with an Agentic AI architecture to transform structured ICU patient data into coordinated clinical and operational decisions.

Unlike traditional static ML models, this system combines:

🧠 Agents Description

1️⃣ Clinical Agent
Predicts mortality probability
Computes severity score
Classifies risk as Low / Medium / High

2️⃣ Admin Agent
Maps predicted risk to ICU clinical protocols
Retrieves guideline recommendations

3️⃣ Operations Agent
Simulates ICU resource conditions
Allocates beds and staff using reinforcement learning logic

4️⃣ Orchestrator Agent
Integrates all agent outputs
Produces structured, explainable final decision
